# Formula to calculate compound interest annually is given by: 
# A = P(1 + R/100) t 
# Compound Interest = A â€“ P 
# Where, 
# A is amount 
# P is principle amount 
# R is the rate and 
# T is the time span
# Ex:
# Input : Principle (amount): 1200
#         Time: 2
#         Rate: 5.4
# Output : Compound Interest = 133.099243
